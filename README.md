# Predict Housing Price Capstone Project

### In this project, I will develop a program that can predict the price of a house based on the dataset found in housing.csv; this program is to demonstrate my knowledge and skills in machine learning.

### First. I used data wrangling technique from Pandas to clean, observe, and modify the data. Then, in the ML Prototype notebook file, I used linear regression model to train and test the data, and compared its accuracy with other algorithms such as Random Forests.

### After that, I used Keras to create a deep learning version of the data with Tensorflow backend. Without any major feature engineering, this approach gives MAE of around $79K.
